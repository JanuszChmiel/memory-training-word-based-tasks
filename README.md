# memory training word based tasks
 Repo will contain Pascal Pas2JS compatible WEB apps. The aim of those apps is to allow people from Czech Republic to perform various memory training activities such as word football and various word based quizzes. People will also need to guess the full names of The Czech TV actors. Apps will be created thanks to modified Demo app which is the part of Pas2js compiler. The advantage of those WEB apps is the fact, that it is compatible with many WEB browsers and app is 100 screens reading software friendly. Because I Am visually impaired with no sight at all, my apps will not contain pictures at all. Only text based memory exercises will be presented. Apps will be fully static. No of apps here will store cookies, no of those apps will store files on computer where it will be executed. Sure, no files will be read from running hosting computers. And my apps are static so no data will be sending to the other parties. So all apps are respecting userâ€™s privacy. No personal data will be required. I would like to thank Microsoft corporation for their opportunity to host opensource project for free including WEB content and Javascript codes. Thank you again dear  Microsoft CORP.
